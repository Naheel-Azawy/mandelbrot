Nothing so special here. Just some weekend fun..

mandelbrot.c:
Does everything here.
Compile with `gcc -lm mandelbrot.c -o mandelbrot` or use my magical executor! (https://github.com/Naheel-Azawy/Executor)
Tested on linux. It should work on windows as well, hopefully.

gen-my-wall.sh:
That's my wallpaper at the moment.

gen-julia-thing.sh:
Something like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set#/media/File:JSr07885.gif
I know bash is a bad idea here, but.. whatever..
